# Plant Species Identification Project - TODO List

## Phase 1: Setup and Data Preparation ✅
- [x] Analyze existing components (leaf detector, classifier, dataset)
- [x] Create unified project structure
- [x] Prepare dataset for training

## Phase 2: Train Species Classifier ✅
- [x] Extract features from dataset images
- [x] Train Random Forest classifier on the 9 species
- [x] Validate classifier performance
- [x] Save trained model

## Phase 3: Create Unified Pipeline ✅
- [x] Create main pipeline script combining leaf detection + species ID
- [x] Integrate leaf detector from algo1.ipynb
- [x] Add species classification step
- [x] Handle non-leaf images gracefully

## Phase 4: Testing and Validation ✅
- [x] Test pipeline with provided sample images
- [x] Test with non-leaf images (should reject)
- [x] Validate accuracy on known species
- [x] Create simple command-line interface

## Phase 5: Web Interface ✅
- [x] Create simple web app for image upload
- [x] Display results with confidence scores
- [x] Add batch processing capability

## Files to Create:
- `main_pipeline.py` - Unified pipeline script
- `train_species_classifier.py` - Training script for species model
- `test_pipeline.py` - Testing script
- `models/` - Directory for saved models
- `results/` - Directory for test results
