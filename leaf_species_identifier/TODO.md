# Leaf Species Identifier - TODO

## Completed Tasks
- [x] Create new project directory `leaf_species_identifier`
- [x] Copy essential utility files from `leaf_classifier_project/app/utils/`
  - [x] preprocessing.py
  - [x] leaf_validator.py
  - [x] feature_extraction.py
  - [x] classification.py
- [x] Copy requirements.txt from leaf_classifier_project
- [x] Create main.py script with integrated pipeline
- [x] Create README.md with usage instructions
- [x] Install dependencies (in progress)
- [x] Fix leaf_validator.py to include validate_leaf method
- [x] Fix main.py preprocessing to avoid double image loading
- [x] Test the integrated pipeline with sample images
  - [x] Leaf validation working (rule-based fallback)
  - [x] Image loading and preprocessing working
  - [x] Species classification working with trained model
- [x] Train synthetic models for demonstration
- [x] Verify model loading and prediction functionality
- [x] Test full pipeline with trained models
- [x] Validate the two-step process: leaf validation â†’ species classification
- [x] Create Flask web application (app.py)
- [x] Create HTML templates for web interface
  - [x] index.html (upload page)
  - [x] result.html (results display)
  - [x] about.html (technical details)
  - [x] 404.html and 500.html (error pages)
- [x] Test web application locally
- [x] Update README.md with web app documentation

## Pending Tasks
- [ ] Test with various image formats and edge cases
- [ ] Optimize performance and add error handling
- [ ] Add batch processing capabilities
- [ ] Create sample usage scripts
- [ ] Add model training documentation
- [ ] Test web app with different browsers

## Next Steps
1. Test with additional images and edge cases
2. Add more robust error handling
3. Consider adding batch processing for multiple images
4. Document final results and usage
5. Add model training and deployment guides
